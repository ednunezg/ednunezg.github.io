<p>Having a summer off in between my last two semesters in college seemed like a perfect opportunity to venture on a thru hike. This being my first long solo hike, my main focus for this trip was to maximize the amount of time walking and hitting big daily miles.</p>

<p>My original plan was to make it all the way to Durango. I was going up to pace hitting about 32 miles a day for the first six days, but accidentally going off trail and hitting snowy passes at the Collegiate West section led to me losing a considerable amount of time and made me reconsider my goals. I managed to make it to Silverton by hitting around 26 miles a day for the rest of the trip.</p>

<p>This has been one of the most rewarding thru hikes Iâ€™ve done and it was great meeting like-minded thru-hikers along the way. Hiking in the Sierras in 2015 gave me some big aspirations to come back there for a PCT thru hike, and now doing the Colorado Trail makes me want to do the CDT and experience the San Juans again.</p>
