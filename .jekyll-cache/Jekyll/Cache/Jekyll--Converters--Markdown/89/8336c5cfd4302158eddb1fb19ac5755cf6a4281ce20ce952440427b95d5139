I"­<p>Between November of 2020 and May 2021, I dedicated most of my time to building my dream home of wheels. It has been a labor of love and patience putting this together from CAD modeling every structure to materializing the build with carpentry work. Although my background is more aligned to software engineer and I had no prior building/carpentry experience, this project is one of the proudest feats Iâ€™ve accomplished.</p>
