<p>Kelsey is living in London this year so I decided to visit her during Spring Break. We made a trip out to Scotland for a 4 days and the Skye Trail seemed like the most scenic, yet accesible option for a quick backpacking trip.</p>

<p>This island had some scenery straight out of a fantasy dragon-land, but the weather was pretty brutal. The winds were so strong we had to bail out after coming up a mountain pass near the Storr  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.</p>

<p>With no chance for us to survive the storm in a tent, we sought shelter in a castle dungeon. The storms calmed down and we made our escape out of Skye, with the hopes of coming back someday.</p>
