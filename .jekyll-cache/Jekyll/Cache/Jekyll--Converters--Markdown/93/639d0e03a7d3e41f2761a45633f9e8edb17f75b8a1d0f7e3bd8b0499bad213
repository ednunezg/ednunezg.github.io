<p>Day trading is an intense game where you are competing with a large crowd of investors to react to market conditions that you can predict and react with speed. In theory, trading in an automated fashion can allow you to generate profits with a speed and frequency that is impossible for a human to execute. Other added benefits include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can detach yourself psychologically and emotionally from your trading decisions once you cement a trust in your strategy.</li>
  <li>Your strategy is testable against historical price data. This also means you optimize algorithm parameter by permutating these on multiple backtests</li>
  <li>Low risk of manual error while placing orders</li>
</ul>

<p>However, by doing this you are subject to the major risk of possible system failures. If you build this system, it is important that you have a fail safe methods to cover for losses caused by these failures. In this post, I will show you how I covered some of these cases.</p>

<p>A succesful strategy is one where you make judgements based on indicators you collect that can give you an edge on the market. In my experience, the process of selecting and tuning a succesful strategy is based more on how fast you can iterate and test different strategy parameters more than understanding the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of how your strategy might work. With no formal finance background, I managed to leverage my programming knowledge to create a system by which I can easily and quickly test my strategy on thousands of strategy permulations, and then decide if I should run my strategy that day based on my confidence level of historical results.</p>

<h2 id="my-bots-strategy">My bot‚Äôs strategy</h2>

<p>My trading bot strategy falls into the category of low-frequency day trading with each trade consiting of a large quantity of stocks ($10k - $100k worth). The trades are low-frequency because the trades are contingent on a trendline being found on a candlestick chart once every few minutes.</p>

<p>For my strategy, it was appropiate to use the OCO model of order placement.</p>
