<p>
I'm Ed, a full-stack software engineer interested in doing high-impact work with highly-energetic people! Currently looking for my next career move. On the side, I build and maintain <a target="_blank" href="https://deadlyarchive-5q6q.onrender.com">Deadly Archive</a> - an interactive live music archive.
</p>

<p>
    During my 2.5 year stint at <a target="_blank"  href="https://coinlist.co/">CoinList</a>, I helped scale up a wide set of operational touchpoints for the company - building out data warehousing, data reporting, numerous internal tools, compliance rules & controls for users, and much more.

    I also had a major role on re-designing KYC/KYB onboarding - boosting time to onboard and reducing multiple onboarding friction points.
</p>

<p>
Prior, have spent my time <a target="_blank" href="http://ednunez.me/tech/2021/03/18/Algotrading.html">algorithmic trading</a>,  founding an AR product over at <a target="_blank" href="http://ednunez.me/tech/2021/03/18/Glimpse.html">Glimpsecard</a>, and working on the UberEats Pricing Team.
</p>

<p>
I am well versed in Go, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, Python, data pipelines, data reporting, (and am constantly adding to this list!). Check out my <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.url }}/projects"> project portfolio!</a>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, I'll go <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.url }}/outside">outside</a> to run until my toenails fall off or venture on overnight hikes.

Here's my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.github.com/ednunezg">Github</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ednunezg/">LinkedIn</a>.

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;">See how I can provide value to your team:</p>

    <ul id="valueList" style="display: none; list-style-type: '- '; line-height: normal; margin-left: 16px;">
        <li><b>Process oriented engineer:</b> Always seeking to find common ground to instill order in organizational chaos.</li>
        <li><b>Designing and creating beautiful full stack web experiences:</b> Fluent in React.JS and integrating it with any backend. I seek to build pixel-perfect experiences for people with their UX in mind.</li>
        <li><b>Finding the 90/10 low hanging fruit for operationally heavy work:</b> Proven track record of automating away hours of people's valuable time so they can do work that matters.</li>
        <li><b>Making your org more data driven:</b> Great data fluency. Data access is important to me - whether you need to build out a data warehouse, or create structured clean data so people can make great decisions + streamline data workflows.</li>
        <li><b>Throw any problem at me:</b> I enjoy obsessing about a challenge and figuring things out, even if if it's an unfamiliar domain to me.</li>
