<p>
My name is Ed, and I'm a backend software engineer interested in working on high-impact projects with highly-energetic people!
</p>

<p>
I am the CTO / founding engineer at <a href="https://glimpsecard.com">Glimpsecard</a>. Formerly, I was a software engineer at Uber where I helped build high QPS and none-to-little downtime systems responsible for orchestrating complex real-time pricing levers for UberEats. I have also worked as an intern for Medtronic and UnitedHealth Group.
</p>

<p>
I am well versed in Go, Java, C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, Python, and Bash (and am constantly adding to this list). I enjoy tinkering with Arduino boards and contributing to open source web projects. Check out my <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects"> project portfolio!</a>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, I'll go <a href="{{ site.url }}/outside">outside</a> to run until my toenails fall off or venture on overnight hikes.
</p>

<p>
Here's my <a href="http://www.github.com/ednunezg">Github</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ednunezg/">LinkedIn</a>. If you'd like to contact me, feel free to drop me a line at <a href="mailto:ed@ednunez.me">ed@ednunez.me</a>. Look forward to hearing from you!
